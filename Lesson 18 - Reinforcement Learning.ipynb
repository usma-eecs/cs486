    "\n",
    "A **passive reinforcement learning** agent does not dictate actions. It simply follows a policy, perhaps a random policy, and gather observations, or **samples**, to determine the value of a state. There are three passive reinforcement learning techniques: Direct utility estimation, adaptive dynamic programming, and temporal-difference learning. \n",

    "### Direct Utility Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct utility estimation follows a policy until it reaches a terminal state - we'll call this a single **trial**. At each step, it logs the current state and reward. When it reaches the terminal it estimates the utility for each state for *that* iteration by  summing the rewards from that state to the terminal one. It continues to run trials, calculating the average utility of each state.\n",
