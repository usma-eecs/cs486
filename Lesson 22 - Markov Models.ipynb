    "Example: Picking one out of the two coins at random would result in a 1/2 probability of having picked the fair coin. However, the question was, what is the probability of having picked the fair coin, GIVEN THAT the coin came up heads. The probability of having picked the fair coin is dependent on the evidence we have (it came up heads)"
